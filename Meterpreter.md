The Meterpreter is an advanced payload that has been part of Metasploit since 2004. Originally written by Matt "skape" Miller, dozens of contributors have provided additional code, and the payload continues to be frequently updated as part of Metasploit development.

Meterpreter development occurs in a [separate repository](https://github.com/rapid7/meterpreter) and the compiled results are published as part of the [metasploit-payloads gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/metasploit-payloads). Meterpreter pull requests are [[landed|Landing Meterpreter Pull Requests]] in a slightly different way compared t changes in the Metasploit Framework. For a detailed understanding of the Meterpreter architecture, please review the [development guide](https://dev.metasploit.com/documents/meterpreter.pdf).
