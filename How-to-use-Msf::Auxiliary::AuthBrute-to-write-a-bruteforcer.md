For all of your password brute-forcing needs, Msf::Auxiliary::AuthBrute has got your back. This is a dictionary-based mixin, and it automatically manages the credential list for you. First off, obviously you can always supply your own lists - a list of usernames, a list of passwords, and/or a list of both, and the mixin will automatically manage them in memory. It can also reuse all the found usernames or passwords that are already stored in the database, that way as you do your pentest, you don't have to manually build a separate wordlist, and as an user you should try to take advantage of this feature.
