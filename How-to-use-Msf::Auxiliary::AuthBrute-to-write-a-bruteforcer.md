For all of your password brute-forcing needs, Msf::Auxiliary::AuthBrute has got your back. This is a dictionary-based mixin, and it automatically collects and manages the wordlist from various sources: a list of usernames or passwords of your own, or a list that contains both, or whatever is already stored in the database so that you don't have to manually build one on your own in the middle of a pentest.
