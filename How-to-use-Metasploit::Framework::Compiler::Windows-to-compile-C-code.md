```Metasploit::Framework::Compiler::Windows``` is a wrapper of [Metasm](https://github.com/jjyg/metasm) specifically for compiling C code for the Windows platform. The purpose of the wrapper is to support default headers, such as `stdio.h`, `stdio.h`, `Windows.h`, or some other important headers that you might use while writing in C.
