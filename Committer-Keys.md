# Signing criteria

In order to get @todb-r7 to sign your key, you should a) tell him your Key ID over some mechanism (IRC, Skype, etc, and b) post it to https://gist.github.com under your GitHub account. If you are near by, he'll ask you about it. If not, he'll e-mail you, using that key, and expect a response.
