# Metasploit Bug Reporting

As Metasploit's popularity grows among penetration testers, exploit developers, and security researchers, there is a tendency to see an increase in bug report volume with a corresponding decrease in bug report quality. The purpose of this page is to give some guidance on how to file quality bug reports, how to categorize issues, and how to fix bugs that we already know about.

# Redmine

The final destination for bug reports in Metasploit is our Redmine [issue tracker](https://dev.metasploit.com/redmine/projects/framework/issues?set_filter=1). In order to file bug reports, one must first [create an account](https://dev.metasploit.com/redmine/account/register) -- sadly, we can't take anonymous bug reports at this time due to spam.

Alternatively, if you have a support contract for a Metasploit product, you ought to get in touch with your support representative, or write to support@rapid7.com. Those bugs often end up in Redmine as well, but they're tracked slightly differently.

Finally, something about security.
