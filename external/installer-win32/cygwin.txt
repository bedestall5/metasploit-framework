The Metasploit Framework 3.3 release uses Cygwin as a compatibility environment for the Windows platform.
The specific version of Cygwin used is a CVS snapshot from August 24th, 2009:
	http://cygwin.com/snapshots/cygwin-src-20090824.tar.bz2

A patch was applied to allow other copies of Cygwin to run in parallel to Metasploit.
	This patch can be found in: patches/cygwin-snapshot-20090824-1_version.diff

In accordance with the terms of the GPL, source code for all GNU and Cygwin packages
included in the Windows installation of the Metasploit Framework are available by
request. With the exception of the Cygwin patch above and items listed below, all
binaries are taken from a standard Cygwin 1.7 installation.

Packages that were not included with Cygwin but are bundled with the installer:

	Ruby 1.9.1p248 (built from source)
	VNCViewer.exe (from RealVNC)
	WinVi32 (from www.winvi.de)
