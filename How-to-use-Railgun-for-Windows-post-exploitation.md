Railgun is a very powerful post exploitation feature exclusive to Windows Meterpreter. It allows you to have complete control of your target machine's Windows API, or you can use whatever DLL you find and do even more creative stuff with it. There are actually quite a few developers and contributors behind Railgun, but the main ones are: Patrick HVE, who originally authored it in Jun 2010. Stephen Fewer: who added x64 supported a few months later. Chao-mu: who made additional major improvements in 2011. As well as others: Ben Cambell, OJ Reeves, and of course, formal and current full-time Metasploit developers, etc. Railgun is also very popular in conference talks, white papers, blogs, pentesting courses... etc, once you've tried it, you cannot live without it.
