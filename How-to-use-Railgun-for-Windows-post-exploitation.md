Railgun is a very powerful post exploitation feature exclusive to Windows Meterpreter. It allows you to have complete control of your target machine's Windows API, or you can use whatever DLL you find and do even more creative stuff with it. For example: say you have a meterpreter session on a Windows target. You have your eyes on a particular application that you believe stores the user's password, but it is encrypted and there are no tools out there for decryption. With Railgun, what you can do is you can either tab into the process and grep for any sensitive information found in memory, or you can look for the program's DLL that's responsible for the decryption, call it, and let it decrypt it for you. If you're a penetration tester, obviously post exploitation is an important skill to have, but if you don't know Railgun, you are missing out a lot.
