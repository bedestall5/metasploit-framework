Railgun is a very powerful post exploitation feature exclusive to Windows Meterpreter. It allows you to have complete control of your target machine's Windows API, or you can use whatever DLL you find and do even more creative stuff with it. For example: say you have a meterpreter session on a Windows target. You have your eyes on a particular application that you believe stores the user's password, but it is encrypted and there are no tools out there for decryption. With Railgun, what you can do is you can either tab into the process and grep for any sensitive information found in memory, or you can look for the program's DLL that's responsible for the decryption, call it, and let it decrypt it for you. If you're a penetration tester, obviously post exploitation is an important skill to have, but if you don't know Railgun, you are missing out a lot.

The Windows API is obviously quite large, so by default Railgun only comes with a handful of pre-defined DLLs and functions that are commonly used in penetration testing. These built-in DLLs are: kernel32, ntdll, user32, ws2_32, iphlpapi, advapi32, shell32, netapi32, crypt32, wlanapi, wldap32, version. Each DLL definition is found in the "def" directory, where they are defined as classes. So for shell32 for example, it is named as ```class Def_shell32```, and there is a ```self_create_dll``` method that will initialize all the shell32 functions by using the ```add_function``` method.
