## Learning Git

The following sites are great references for Git padawans and jedi alike:

* [learn.github.com](http://learn.github.com): GitHub's own reference site. Includes helpful GitHub-specific information.
* [Git Reference](http://gitref.org): From the site: "meant to be a quick reference for learning and remembering the most important and commonly used Git commands." Follows a tutorial-like format. Great for beginners.
* [The Pro Git Book](http://progit.org): A free, online copy of the Pro Git book by GitHubber Scott Chacon.
* [The Git Community Book](http://book.git-scm.com): A free book put together by the Git community for those new to Git.
* [Git Magic](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~blynn/gitmagic/): Another free Git book put together by a Stanford CS student.
* [Git Ready](http://gitready.com): A collection of Git tips and tricks.
* [Why Git is Better Than X](http://whygitisbetterthanx.com): In case you still need convincing, this site breaks down Git vs. other popular SCM packages.
* [The Git Parable](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2009/05/19/the-git-parable.html): A story by GitHub founder Tom Preston-Werner that reveals the underlying principles behind Git's construction. A great starting point for understanding the nature of Git.
* [PeepCode](http://peepcode.com/products/git) Not free, a ~60 minute video.  Well made, I found it super helpful.

## SVN mirroring

Of course, if you're still having trouble, GitHub does offer [basic SVN read-write support](https://github.com/blog/644-subversion-write-support).
