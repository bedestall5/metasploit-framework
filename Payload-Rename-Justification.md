Many payloads perform the same task, yet have different names. This results in confusion and a bad new-user experience. Specifically, ARCH_CMD payloads differ greatly from their shellcode-derived brethren. For example, the most heavily used payload is `windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`; the equivalent in ARCH_CMD land is `cmd/unix/reverse`, which gives no indication that the session type will be a shell.
