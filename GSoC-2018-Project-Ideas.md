GSoC Project Ideas in no particular order. When you've picked one, take a look at [[GSoC-2018-Student-Proposal]] for how to make a proposal.


### Submit your own

If you want to suggest your own idea, please discuss it with us first on [our mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/metasploit-hackers) to make sure it is a reasonable amount of work for a summer and that it fits the goals of the project.

### Session-style module interaction

Metasploit has the concept of 'sessions' where a connection context can define its own set of console operations. E.g. if you interact with a session, Metasploit switches to a specific subconsole for interaction. It would be nice as an alternative to 'action' for auxiliary modules, or as a way to merge related modules, to simply interact with the module.
