Post module development is a challenge to your programming skills. It's not like writing a memory corruption based exploit, where technically speaking is usually about crafting a malicious input - a string. A post module is more about proper module design, practical knowledge in Ruby and the Metasploit library. It's also a very valuable skill to have, because if you don't know what to do after popping a shell, what's the point of the penetration test, right? Also, what if a module doesn't work? Are you willing to wait days, weeks, or maybe even months for someone else to fix it for you? Probably not. If you know how to do it yourself, you can probably fix it in 10 minutes, and continue with your pentest and do more things.
