The real kung-fu behind exploit development isn't actually about which language you choose to build it, it's about your precise understanding of how an input is processed by the application you're debugging, and how to gain control by manipulating it. That's right, the keyword is "debugging." Your binjitsu (reverse-engineering) is where the real kung-fu is. However, if your goal isn't just about popping a calculator, but actually want to weaponize, to maintain, and to provide use in the practical world, you need a development framework. And this is where Metasploit comes in. It's a framework that's free and open-source, actively contributed by researchers from around the world. So when you write a Metasploit exploit, you don't have to worry about people not having the libraries the exploit needs, or the wrong version, or not having enough payloads for difference scenarios to choose from, etc. The idea is all you need to do is focus on building that exploit, and nothing more.
