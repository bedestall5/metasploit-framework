The real kung-fu behind exploit development isn't actually about which language you choose to build it, it's about your precise understanding of how an input is processed by the application you're debugging, and how to gain control by manipulating it. That's right, the keyword is "debugging." Your binjitsu (reverse-engineering) is where the real kung-fu is. However, if your goal isn't just about popping a calculator, but actually want to weaponize, to maintain, and to provide use in the practical world, you need a development framework. And this is where Metasploit comes in. It's a framework that's free and open-source, actively contributed by researchers around the world. So when you write a Metasploit exploit, you don't have to worry about people not having the same libraries the exploit needs, or the wrong version, or not having enough payloads for different pentesting scenarios to choose from, etc. The idea is all you need to do is focus on building that exploit, and nothing more.

### Plan your module

Unlike writing a proof-of-concept, when you write a Metasploit module you need to think about how users might use it in the real world. Stealth is usually an important element to think about. Can your exploit achieve code execution without dropping a file? Can the input look more random so it's more difficult to detect? How about obfuscation? Is it generating unnecessary traffic? Can it be more stable without crashing the system so much, etc, etc.

Also, try to be precise about exploitable requirements. Usually, a bug is specific to a range of versions, or even builds. If you can't automatically check that, you need to at least mention it in the description somewhere. Some of your exploit's techniques might also be application-specific. For example, you can take advantage of a specific behavior in the application to generate heap allocations the way you want, but maybe it's more noisy in the newer version so that gives you some stability issues. Does it need a 3rd-party component to work that may not even be installed by everyone? Even if it is, is the component revised often that could make your exploit less reliable?

Know that in the real world, your exploit can break or fail in a lot of different ways. You should try to find out and fix it during the development and testing phase before use.

### Ranking

As you can see, reliability is important to Metasploit, and we try to be more friendly about this for the users. I know what you're thinking: "Well, if they're using the exploit they should understand how it works, so they know what they're getting themselves into." In the perfect world, yes. Knowing how a vulnerability works or how an exploit works will only benefit the user, but you see, we don't live in the perfect world.
