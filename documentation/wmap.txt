=[ Intro.

WMAP is a general purpose web application scanning framework for 
Metasploit 3. The architechture is simple and its simplicity is what makes
it powerfull. It's a different approach compared to other open source 
alternatives and commercial scanners, as WMAP is not build around any browser 
or spider for data capture and manipulation. 


=[ How it works.

In the WMAP design, the attack proxy acts as a data gathering tool. All 
traffic between the client(s) (i.e. favorite browser and/or spider) will be 
stored in the MSF database. (See figure.) 

[CLIENT] ----- [ATTACK PROXY] ----- [TARGET]
                      |                 ^ 
               [METASPLOIT DB]          |
                      |                 |
            [MSF 3 - WMAP SCANNER]      | 
            [MSF 3 - WMAP MODULES] -----+

WMAP is a Metasploit plugin and will interact with the database, reading all
gathered traffic, processing it and launching the different tests 
implemented as modules.  As WMAP Modules are MSF Modules they can be easily 
implemented, and can be run manually from the command line or automatically 
via WMAP.

As you may see this simple architecture allows you to have different 
distributed clients and even different proxies all storing data to the 
central repository. Remember everything is based on Metasploit, the test 
modules are implemented as auxiliary modules and they can interact with any 
other MSF component including the database, exploits and plugins.


=[ WMAP Modules.
 	 
The test modules implemented at this time are basic and will improve over 
time not only in quality and quantity, so you are more than welcome to 
submit new modules.

Each module has a WMAP type, this determine when the module is launched and
to a certain degree, the minimum type of information it requires to be 
executed. The best way to develop a new test for WMAP, is to use already 
implemented modules as a base and then develop a normal MSF module that can 
be run manually from the command line. To enable a module to be run 
automatically via WMAP  just include the mixin that determine the type 
of the module. 

	Example:

	include Auxiliary::WMAPScanFile

The following are the types of modules implemented at this time and they are
listed in the order WMAP runs them:

WMAPScanServer      - Run once against the target Web Server
WMAPScanDir         - Runs for every directory found in the target 
WMAPScanFile        - Runs for every file found in the target
WMAPScanUniqueQuery - Runs for every unique query found in each request to the 
                      target 
WMAPScanQuery       - Runs for every query found in each request to the target
WMAPScanBody        - Runs for every Body found in each request to the target
WMAPScanHeaders     - Runs for every Header found in each request to the target
WMAPScanGeneric     - Modules to be run after all tests complete. Good place to
                      perform passive analysis of responses, analysis of test
                      results to launch other modules (i.e. exploits). 
	
=[ Simple example.

The following are the basic steps for testing a web server/app using WMAP: 

  1. Mentally choose a target ...;
  2. Launch a wmap enabled attack proxy;
          
     NOTE: Eventually WMAP will include its own attack proxy code and spider
     and at this time WMAP integrates very well with lcamtuf's ratproxy 
     (via a patch located in the /external/ratproxy directory). 

	 ratproxy (ratproxy_wmap.diff applied) basic example: 

	 $ ./ratproxy -v /Users/et/.msf3/ -b sqlite3.db 
   	 ratproxy version 1.51-beta by <lcamtuf@google.com>
   	 [*] Proxy configured successfully. Have fun, and please do not be evil.
   	 [+] Accepting connections on port 8080/tcp (local only)...

     NOTE: If you want to use a different database than the default MSF database
     or was destroyed. You have to create again the database with the 'db_create'
     command. 'db_create <path/database>':

         msf > db_create /dir/target_test.db
         [*] Creating a new database instance...
         [*] Successfully connected to the database
         [*] File: /dir/target_test.db

  3. Browse the target by running your favorite spider/crawler/browser etc.
     NOTE: Dont forget to configure the proxy;

  4. In Metasploit load the db_<database> plugin;

     $ ./msfconsole

                      |                    |      _) |  
       __ `__ \   _ \ __|  _` |  __| __ \  |  _ \  | __|
       |   |   |  __/ |   (   |\__ \ |   | | (   | | |  
      _|  _|  _|\___|\__|\__,_|____/ .__/ _|\___/ _|\__|
                                    _|

      or you want to modify the value of a predefined variable, 
      this can be done with the 'setg' command.

      msf > setg DOMAIN targetco.com
      DOMAIN => targetco.com

more of a placeholder of the things you may see in the near future.

- Add more commands
- Develop more modules
- Create more module types to perform tasks like response analysis
- Support other databases (only sqlite3 supported at this time)
