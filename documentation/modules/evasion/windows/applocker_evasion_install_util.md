## Intro

This module is designed to evade solutions such as software restriction policies and Applocker.
The main vector for this bypass is to use the trusted binary Install_Util.exe in executing user supplied code.

## Vulnerable Application

This evasion will work on all versions of Windows that include .net versions 3.5 or greater (note: ensure the selected payload matches the target os architecture).
