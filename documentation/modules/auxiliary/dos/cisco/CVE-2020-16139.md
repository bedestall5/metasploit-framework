## Vulnerable Application

  [Cisco 7937G](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/collaboration-endpoints/unified-ip-conference-station-7937g/model.html) Conference Station.
  This module has been tested successfully against SCCP-1-4-5-5 and SCCP-1-4-5-7.
 
### Description
 
This module exploits a bug in how the conference station handles executing a ping via it's web interface. By repeatedly executing the ping function without clearing out the resulting output, a DoS is caused that will reset the device after a few minutes. 

## Verification Steps

  1. Obtain a Cisco 7937G Conference Station.
  2. Enable Web Access on the device (default configuration).
  3. Start msfconsole
  4. Do: `use auxiliary/dos/cisco/CVE-2020-16139`
  5. Do: `set RHOST 192.168.1.10`
  6. Do: `run`
  7. The conference station should become nonresponsive and then power cycle itself.

## Scenarios

### Cisco 7937G SCCP-1-4-5-7
