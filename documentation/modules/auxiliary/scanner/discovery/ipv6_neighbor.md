## Description

This auxiliary module probes the local network for IPv6 hosts that respond to Neighbor Solicitations with a link-local address. This module, like the arp_sweep one, will generally only work within the attacking machineâ€™s broadcast domain. It serves the dual-purpose of showing what hosts are online similar to arp_sweep and then performs the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery.

## Verification Steps

1. Do: ```use auxiliary/scanner/discovery/ipv6_neighbor```
2. Do: ```set RHOSTS [IP]```
3. Do: ```set SHOST [IP]```
4. Do: ```set SMAC [MAC]```
5. Do: ```set THREADS [number of threads]```
6. Do: ```run```

In addition to setting our RHOSTS value, we also need to set our source MAC address(SMAC) and source host(SHOST) IP address. We then set our RHOSTS and THREADS values and let the scanner run.

## Scenarios

**Running the scanner**
```
msf > use auxiliary/scanner/discovery/ipv6_neighbor
msf auxiliary(ipv6_neighbor) > show options
