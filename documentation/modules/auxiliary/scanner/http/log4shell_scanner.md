## Vulnerable Application
This module will scan an HTTP end point for the Log4Shell vulnerability by injecting a format message that will
trigger an LDAP connection to Metasploit. This module is a generic scanner and is only capable of identifying
instances that are vulnerable via one of the pre-determined HTTP request injection points. These points include
HTTP headers and the HTTP request path.

This module has been successfully tested with Struts2 and Spring Boot.

## Verification Steps

1. Setup a vulnerable Struts2 Instance
2. Start msfconsole
3. Do: `use auxiliary/scanner/http/log4shell_scanner`
4. Set the `SRVHOST`, `RHOSTS`, `RPORT` and `TARGETURI` options
    * For Struts2, set `TARGETURI` to `/struts2-showcase/`
5. Do: `run`
6. The target should be identified as vulnerable

### Struts2 Setup

The following docker file can be used to setup a vulnerable Struts2 instance for testing.

```
#
# To build the image:
#   docker build . -t struts2:2.5.28
# To run the container:
#   docker run --name struts2 --rm -p 8080:8080 struts2:2.5.28
#

ARG version=2.5.28
FROM bitnami/tomcat:9.0
USER root
ENV TOMCAT_PASSWORD password

RUN apt-get update && \
	apt-get -y install unzip && \
	apt-get clean && \
	rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* /tmp/* /var/tmp/*

RUN curl https://dlcdn.apache.org/struts/2.5.28/struts-2.5.28-all.zip > struts-all.zip && \
	unzip struts-all.zip && \
	cp /struts-2.5.28/apps/struts2-showcase.war /bitnami/tomcat/webapps/
```


## Options

### HTTP_METHOD
The HTTP method to use.

### HEADERS_FILE
File containing headers to check, one per line. Lines starting with `#` will be treated as comments.

### URIS_FILE
File contianing additional URIs to check, one per line. These values will be appended to the `TARGETURI` option. Lines 
starting with `#` will be treated as comments.

### TIMEOUT
Time to wait to receive LDAP connections.
