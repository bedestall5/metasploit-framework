* There is a Windows SMB Server on the LAN
* There is a Windows SMB Client on the LAN
* Metasploit is running will full local socket access (ex. as root user)

## Verification Steps

1. Run bettercap targeting both the SMB Client and Server
2. Start msfconsole
3. Do `use exploit/windows/smb/smb_shadow`
4. Do `run`
5. Wait for the SMB Client to connect to the SMB Server as Administrator

## Scenarios

**Active Windows Network**

Follow the following steps to target all the hosts on the LAN:

1. Run bettercap targeting the entire LAN
2. Start msfconole
3. Do `use exploit/windows/smb/smb_shadow`
