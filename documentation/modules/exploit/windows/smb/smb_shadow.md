## Vulnerable Application

To be able to use exploit/windows/smb/smb_shadow, you must meet these requirements:

* There is a Windows SMB Server on the LAN
* There is a Windows SMB Client on the LAN
* Metasploit is running will full local socket access (e.g. as root user)

## Verification Steps

1. Ensure Windows SMB Client and Server are on the LAN
2. Run bettercap targeting both the SMB Client and Server
3. Start msfconsole
4. Do `use exploit/windows/smb/smb_shadow`
5. Do `run`
6. Make a SMB Client connect to the SMB Server as an Administrator
7. Receive a Meterpreter Session as SYSTEM on the SMB Server host

## Scenarios

**Active Windows Network**

Follow the following steps to target all the hosts on the LAN:

1. Run bettercap targeting the entire LAN
2. Start msfconsole
3. Do `use exploit/windows/smb/smb_shadow`
4. Do `run`
5. Wait for any SMB Client to connect to any SMB Server as an Administrator
6. Receive a Meterpreter Session as SYSTEM on the SMB Server host
