## Vulnerable Application

### Description

An HTTP endpoint used by the Manage Engine OpManager Smart Update Manager component can be leveraged to deserialize an
arbitrary Java object. This can be abused by an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute OS commands in the context of
the OpManager application (NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM on Windows or root on Linux). This vulnerability is also present in other
products that are built on top of the OpManager application. This vulnerability affects OpManager versions 12.1 -
12.5.232.

### Setup (Windows)

1. Download an affected version for either Windows or Linux from the [archive][0]
1. Run the installer executable
1. Accept the default values for all settings (skip registration), until the very end when prompted to start the
  application
1. Unselect the option to start the application
    1. If this option is missed, just navigate to the tray icon where it will say that it's starting and select the
      option to stop it
1. Start a command prompt as an administrative user
1. Navigate to `C:\Program Files\ManageEngine\OpManager\bin`, older versions use `C:\ManageEngine\OpManager\bin`
1. Run `run.bat`
1. View and accept the license terms
1. Press `f` to run the product in Free mode

OpManager should start successfully after a few minutes. At that point the service can be exploited. In this case the
session will be opened in the context of the user that ran the service with `run.bat`. Once the server is restarted and
OpManager starts automatically, the vulnerability can be exploited to open a session in the context of NT
AUTHORITY\SYSTEM.

### Setup (Linux)

1. Download an affected version for either Windows or Linux from the [archive][0]
1. Run the installer executable as root
1. Accept the default values for all settings (skip registration)
1. Navigate to `/opt/ManageEngine/OpManagerCentral/bin`
1. Run `run.sh` as root

## Verification Steps

1. Install the application
1. Start msfconsole
1. Do: `use exploit/multi/http/opmanager_sumpdu_deserialization`
1. Set the `RHOSTS`, `TARGET`, `PAYLOAD` and payload-related options as necessary
1. Do: `run`
1. You should get a shell.
