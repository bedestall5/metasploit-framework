## Vulnerable Application

This module exploits a command injection vulnerability within the Nimbus service component of Apache Storm.
The getTopologyHistory RPC method method takes a single argument which is the name of a user which is
concatenated into a string that is executed by bash. In order for the vulnerability to be exploitable, there
must have been at least one topology submitted to the server. The topology may be active or inactive, but at
least one must be present.

This vulnerability was patched in versions 2.1.1, 2.2.1 and 1.2.4. This exploit was tested on version 2.2.0
which is affected.

## Verification Steps

1. Setup a minimal Storm cluster using the published docker images. The following steps were adapted from [Docker
  reference][1].
  * The following steps can be executed to start up a minimal Storm cluster, but requires the [Storm Starter][2] jar
    to exist in the current directory as `topology.jar`. Follow the steps on the [projects page][3] to build it with
    Maven. Storm Starter v2.4.0 was used for testing.

```
# 1. Start a ZooKeeper server:
docker run -d --rm --name some-zookeeper zookeeper
# 2. Start a Nimbus server:
docker run -p 6627:6627 -d --rm --name some-nimbus --link some-zookeeper:zookeeper \
  storm:2.2.0 storm nimbus
# 3. Start a Supervisor server:
docker run -d --rm --name supervisor1 --link some-zookeeper:zookeeper --link some-nimbus:nimbus \
  storm:2.2.0 storm supervisor
# 4. Submit a topology using Storm Starter:
docker run --rm --link some-nimbus:nimbus -it -v $(pwd)/topology.jar:/topology.jar \
  storm:2.2.0 storm jar /topology.jar \
  org.apache.storm.starter.ExclamationTopology exclamation
```
2. Start `msfconsole`
3. Do: `exploit/linux/misc/nimbus_gettopologyhistory_cmd_exec`
4. Set the module options
5. Do: `exploit`
6. You should get a shell
