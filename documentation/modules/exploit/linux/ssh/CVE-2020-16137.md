  4. Do: `set USER test`
  5. Do: `set PASS test`
  6. Do: `run`
  7. The conference station's SSH service should now be configured with the supplied USER:PASS.

## Options

  1. PASS (required) - Desired password
  2. RHOSTS (required) - Target address
  3. THREADS (default 1, required) - The number of concurrent threads (max one per host)
