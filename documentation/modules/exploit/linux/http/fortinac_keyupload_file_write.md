## Vulnerable Application

This module uploads a payload to the `/tmp` directory in addition to a cron job to `/etc/cron.d` which executes the payload
in the context of the `root` user.

The core vulnerability is an arbitrary file write issue in `/configWizard/keyUpload.jsp` which is accessible remotely and without
authentication. When you send this endpoint a ZIP file, it will extract an an attacker controlled file to directory
on the system of the attacker's choice.

This issue is exploitable on the following versions of FortiNAC:

FortiNAC version 9.4 prior to 9.4.1
FortiNAC version 9.2 prior to 9.2.6
FortiNAC version 9.1 prior to 9.1.8
FortiNAC 8.8 all versions
FortiNAC 8.7 all versions
FortiNAC 8.6 all versions
FortiNAC 8.5 all versions
FortiNAC 8.3 all versions

### Setup

Navigate to https://www.fortinet.com/demo-center/nac-demo to obtain a FortiNAC free product demo. Fill out the
necessary fields in order to download: first name, last name, job function, job level, company, email address, phone
number, state, zip/postal code. You'll receive a confirmation email, click the link in the email in order to access the
free product download.

Import the OVF file into your virtualization software of choice. Personally, I had success using VMware Fusion. Change the network
interface from Bridged to Host Only. Once the machine turns on, log in with the following default credentials as outlined
in the [VMware Virtual Machine Installation Guide](https://fortinetweb.s3.amazonaws.com/docs.fortinet.com/v2/attachments/920a0000-200d-11e9-b6f6-f8bc1258b856/fortinac-vmware-install-85.pdf):

```
Username: root
Password: 162PemBnI
```

Once authenticated successfully, statically set the IP Address of the machine:

`configIP 192.168.123.11 255.255.255.0 192.168.123.1`

Navigate to the directory where the license file resides, and then start a Python SimpleHTTPServer web server to
host files from this directory using the following commands:

```
cd /bsc/campusMgr
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9099
```

On your local machine download the license file from the Python server started above:

`wget -O licenseKey http://192.168.123.11:9099/.licenseKey`

On your local machine, open the browser of your choice and navigate to:

`https://192.168.123.11:8443/gui`

Authenticate with the default username and password:

```
Username: root
Password: YAMS
```

Follow the installation steps, everything should be straight forward. When asked for the license key, provide
the `.licenseKey` file you downloaded from the Python HTTP server. Set the hostname to `localhost`.
The domain can be set to `localhost.localdomain`. You will be required to change the default passwords from the
GUI and once complete, restart the machine. You should now have a vulnerable instance of FortiNAC configured.

## Verification Steps

1. Start msfconsole
1. Do: `use exploit/multi/http/fortinac_keyupload_file_upload`
1. Set the `RHOST` and `LHOST` options
1. Run the module
1. Receive a Meterpreter session as the `root` user.
