## Vulnerable Application

  An unauthenticated Java object deserialization vulnerability exists
  in the CLI component found in Jenkins versions `v2.56` and below.

### Installation

  Vulnerable version of Jenkins can be downloaded from [here](https://get.jenkins.io/war-stable/).
  Additionally, a [jdk](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk8-downloads.html) will need to be installed on the target system.

  To start Jenkins, navigate to the location of the downloaded `war` file and execute:
  `java -jar <jenkins-file>.war`. To test if Jenkins is properly working, the CLI component
  can be accessed by navigating to `http://localhost:8080/cli`.

## Verification Steps

  1. Install the application
  2. Start msfconsole
  3. Do: `exploit/linux/http/jenkins_cli_deserialization`
  4. Do: `set RHOST <ip>`
  5. Do: `run`
  6. You should get a shell.
