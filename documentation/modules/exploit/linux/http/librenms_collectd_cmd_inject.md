## Description

  A command injection vulnerability exists in LibreNMS versions prior to `v1.50.1`.

  The injection vulnerability affects the Collectd graphing functionality. Specifically, the `to` and
  `from` parameters used in the range for graphing are sanitized with the `mysqli_escape_real_string()`
  which ignores certain characters, including backticks. These improperly sanitized parameters are then
  used in a shell command that gets executed via the `passthru()` function.

## Vulnerable Application

  A vulnerable version of LibreNMS (v1.50) in the form of an OVA can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/librenms/packer-builds/releases/tag/1.50).

  Login credentials can be found on the official LibreNMS [site](https://docs.librenms.org/Installation/Images/).

## Verification Steps

  Example steps in this format (is also in the PR):

  1. Install the application
  2. Start msfconsole
  3. Do: ```use [module path]```
  4. Do: ```run```
  5. You should get a shell.

## Scenarios

### Version of software and OS as applicable

  Specific demo of using the module that might be useful in a real world scenario.

  ```
  code or console output
  ```

  For example:

  To do this specific thing, here's how you do it:

  ```
  msf > use module_name
  msf auxiliary(module_name) > set POWERLEVEL >9000
  msf auxiliary(module_name) > exploit
  ```
