## Introduction
This module exploits a vulnerability in Nagios XI before 5.6.6 in order to execute arbitrary commands as root.

The module first checks if the supplied credentials are valid and belong to a user with permissions to modify plugins. It then exploits these permissions by uploading a malicious plugin to the target and subsequently sending an HTTP GET request to profile.php?cmd=download. This request downloads a system profile from the server and in the process launches the getprofile.sh script as root via a passwordless sudo entry. This script executes the malicious plugin as root.

For all supported targets except `Linux (cmd)`, the module first starts an HTTP Server to serve the payload, and then writes a wget request for the payload to the malicious plugin. When the plugin is executed, the target requests the payload, which is then sent to the target and executed as root. However, this method will only work if wget is installed on the target, which may not necessarily be true, for instance if Nagios XI is running on a minimal/custom CentOS installation. In the latter case, the target must be set to `Linux (cmd)` and the payload must be set accordingly. For this target, the module does not start an HTTP Server, but writes the payload directly to the malicious plugin instead, thereby avoiding the need for a wget request. In this scenario, the payload `cmd/unix/reverse_bash` is recommended because it the most likely payload to still work on a minimal Linux installation.

Valid credentials for a user with administrative privileges are required. This module was successfully tested on Nagios XI 5.6.5 running on CentOS 7.

## Vulnerable system
Nagios XI before 5.6.6.

## Verification Steps
1. Install the module as usual
2. Start msfconsole
3. Do: `use exploit/linux/http/nagiosxi_authenticated_rce`
4. Do: `set RHOSTS [IP]`
5. Do: `set SRVHOST [IP]`
6. Do: `set USERNAME [username]`
7. Do: `set PASSWORD [password]`
8. Do: `set payload [payload]`
9. Do: `set LHOST [IP]`
10. Do: `set LPORT [port]`
11. Do: `exploit`

## Options
1. `USERNAME`. The username to authenticate with. This user should have permissions to modify plugins. The default setting is `nagiosadmin`, which is the default admin account for Nagios XI systems.
2. `PASSWORD`. The password to authenticate with.

## Targets
0. Linux (x86)
1. Linux (x64) # This is the default target.
2. Linux (cmd) # If wget is not installed on the target, this target should be selected together with the payload cmd/unix/reverse_bash.
