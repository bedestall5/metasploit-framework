## Vulnerable Application
This module exploits command injection vulnerability in v-list-user-backups bash script file. Low privileged authenticated users can execute arbitrary commands under the context of the root user.

An authenticated attacker with a low privileges can inject a payload in the file name starts with dot. During the user backup process, this file name will be evaluated by the v-backup-user bash scripts. As result of that backup process, when an attacker try to list existing backups injected payload will be executed.
        
## Vulnerable Application Installation Steps

You can install Vesta Control Panel on Linux server with following commands.

```
ssh root@your.server
curl -O http://vestacp.com/pub/vst-install.sh
bash vst-install.sh
```

Once you have finished the installation, go to https://IP_ADDR:8083/add/user/ and new unprivileged user with default package.


## Verification Steps

A successful check of the exploit will look like this:

1. Start `msfconsole`
2. `use exploit/linux/http/vestacp_exec `
3. Set `RHOST`
4. Set `LHOST`
4. Set `USERNAME`
4. Set `PASSWORD`
4. Set `SRVHOST`
4. Set `SRVPORT`
7. Run `exploit`
8. **Verify** that you are seeing `Successfully authenticated to the FTP service` in console.
9. **Verify** that you are seeing `Successfully uploaded the payload as a file name` in console.
9. **Verify** that you are seeing `Successfully authenticated to the HTTP Service` in console.
9. **Verify** that you are seeing `Scheduled backup has ben started. Exploitation may take up to 5 minutes.` in console.
9. **Verify** that you are seeing `It seems there is an active backup process ! Recheck after 30 second. Zzzzzz...` in console.
9. **Verify** that you are seeing `First stage is executed ! Sending 2nd stage of the payload` in console.
15. **Verify** that you are getting meterpreter session.
