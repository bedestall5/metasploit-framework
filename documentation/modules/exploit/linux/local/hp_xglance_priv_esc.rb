## Vulnerable Application

Instructions to get the vulnerable application.  If applicable, include links to the vulnerable install files, as well as instructions on installing/configuring the environment if it is different than a standard install. Much of this will come from the PR, and can be copy/pasted.

### Mock Application

```
sudo dnf install motif-devel
cat > main.c << DONE
#include <stdio.h>
#include <Xm/Xm.h>
#include <Xt/Xt.h>
#include <Xp/Xp.h>

void main(){
    printf("HP xglance-bin emulator %d\n",XmVERSION);
    char* x = XmCvtXmStringToCT(NULL);
    printf("%p",x);
}

DONE

gcc -lXm main.c -o xglance-bin -Wl,-rpath=-L/lib64:/usr/lib64:/usr/X11R6/lib64:/opt/perf/lib64
sudo mkdir -p /opt/perf/bin/
sudo cp xglance-bin /opt/perf/bin/
sudo chown root:bin /opt/perf/bin/xglance-bin
sudo chmod 4555 /opt/perf/bin/xglance-bin
```


## Verification Steps
  Example steps in this format (is also in the PR):

  1. Install the application
  2. Start msfconsole
  3. Do: ```use [module path]```
  4. Do: ```run```
  5. You should get a shell.
 
## Options
List each option and how to use it. 

### Option Name

Talk about what it does, and how to use it appropriately.  If the default value is likely to change, include the default value here.

## Scenarios
Specific demo of using the module that might be useful in a real world scenario.


### Version and OS

  ```
  code or console output
  ```

  For example:

  To do this specific thing, here's how you do it:

  ```
  msf > use module_name
  msf auxiliary(module_name) > set POWERLEVEL >9000
  msf auxiliary(module_name) > exploit
  ```
