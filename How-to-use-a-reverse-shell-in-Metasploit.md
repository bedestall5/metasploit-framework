There are two popular types of shells: bind and reverse. A bind shell opens up a new service on the target machine, and requires the attacker to connect to it. A reverse shell is the exact opposite: it requires the attacker to set up a listener first on his box, the target machine acts as a client connecting to that listener, and then finally the attacker receives the shell.

The basic usage of payloads is already quite well documented in the [Users Guide](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/documentation/users_guide_4.3.pdf) in Metasploit's documentation folder. However, learning how to use a reverse shell still remains the most common question in the Metasploit community. Plus, 9 times out of 10 you'd probably be using a reverse shell to get a session, so in this wiki documentation we will explain more about this.
