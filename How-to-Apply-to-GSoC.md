**Note:** Final project proposals must be submitted through to Google through the GSoC Program Website, as stated in the [rules](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/rules/).

Before submitting to the GSoC website, it is also helpful to solicit proposal feedback via one of the contact methods found on <https://metasploit.com/contribute>. If you don't hear back right away on a proposal, don't give up! Contributors may be busy, or you may need to try again to get someone's attention (but don't spam).

# Getting started
Students interesting in GSoC, can start by reading Google's official guides.  
<https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/student-advice>

Review all of the [student guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/) and carefully read the [proposal writing section](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal.html).

A listed `idea` is a seed for GSoC students to expand on and propose how to design and implement a solution.  You can start by investigating the code base and how existing users interaction with msfconsole functionality. Think through scenarios on how a user might want to interact with the proposed idea.

A place to get started with contributing to Metasploit is [here](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and expanded on [here](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/wiki/Contributing-to-Metasploit#framework-bugs-and-features).

GSoC mentors tend to look for those items that have a chance of making development and usage easier or improving the overall performance of a certain area, however by starting with understanding the most common contribution patten you can get familiar with the codebase and also the mindset of users. This will help you in creating a proposal with the end user in mind.

Once you have started digging feel free ask questions that help you understand the concepts you for the idea would like to propose.

Initial proposals can be sent for feedback before offical submission opens to msfdev@metasploit.com. All proposals must be officially submitted during Student Application Period thru the [GSoC official](https://g.co/gsoc) site.

At a bare minimum, proposals should include the following:

## Title

A brief description of what you would like to work on. See [[GSoC-2021-Project-Ideas]] for ideas.

## Vitals

* Your name
* Contact info - include at least:
  - an email address
  - github user name
  - Freenode nick

## Skillz

What programming languages are you familiar with, in order of proficiency? Most of Metasploit is written in Ruby; for any project you will most likely need at least a passing knowledge of it. If you want to work on Meterpreter or Mettle, C will be necessary as well. 

What other projects have you worked on before?


## Your project

Fill in the details. What exactly do you want to accomplish?
