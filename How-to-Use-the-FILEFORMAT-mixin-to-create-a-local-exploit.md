```Msf::Exploit::FILEFORMAT``` is the mixin to use to create a local exploit. There actually isn't much in the mixin, but the most important method is this: ```file_create```:

### Usage for file_create

As the name implies, the ```file_create``` method allows you to create a file. You should be using this method because it does more than just writing data to disk. One of the important things it does is it will report the file creation to the database in the format of ```#{ltype}.localpath```, and it will always write the file to Metasploit's local directory defined in ```Msf::Config.local_directory``` (by default this path is ```~/.msf4/local```), which keep files nice and organized.

To use the mixin, first include ```Msf::Exploit::FILEFORMAT``` under the scope of your ```Metasploit3``` class:

```ruby
include Msf::Exploit::FILEFORMAT
```

And here's an example of using ```file_create``` to build my imaginary exploit:

```ruby
# This is my imaginary exploit
buf = ""
buf << "A" * 1024
buf << [0x40201f01].pack("V")
buf << "\x90" * 10
buf << payload.encoded

file_create(buf)
```
