Are you anxious to get your [Metasploit Development Environment](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/wiki/Setting-Up-a-Metasploit-Development-Environment) set up and start [[Landing Pull Requests]] and contribute excellent exploit code? If so, you're in the right place.

Are you a user of Metasploit, and want to hack stuff (that you have permission to hack) just like in the movies? You should [download Metasploit](http://www.rapid7.com/products/metasploit/download.jsp) and not have to worry about setting up your dependencies or your git branches or whatever. Also note that while the Community version is free and fun, the Pro version has a 14-free trial. Take a couple weeks to determine what's right for you.

If you're an exploit developer, you will want to review our [[Guidelines for Accepting Modules and Enhancements]] to find out what all we expect when we see pull requests for new Metasploit modules.
