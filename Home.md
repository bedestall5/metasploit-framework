Are you anxious to get your [Metasploit Development Environment](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/wiki/Setting-Up-a-Metasploit-Development-Environment) set up and start [[Landing Pull Requests]] and contribute excellent exploit code? If so, you're in the right place.

Are you a Metasploit user, and want to hack stuff (that you have permission to hack) just like in the movies? The quickest way to get started is to [download the Metasploit binary installer](http://www.rapid7.com/products/metasploit/download.jsp). This will give you access to all Metasploit editions: the free, open source Metasploit Framework, the free Metasploit Community edition, and a free
trial of Metasploit Pro.

If you’re using [Kali Linux](http://kali.org), Metasploit is already pre-installed; just type `msfconsole`
in the terminal to start Metasploit Framework, then type `go_pro` if you’d like to use try Metasploit Pro
or Metasploit Community.

If you're an exploit developer, you will want to review our [[Guidelines for Accepting Modules and Enhancements]] to find out what all we expect when we see pull requests for new Metasploit modules. No idea what you should start working on? Check out the guidelines for [[contributing to Metasploit]], and dive in
